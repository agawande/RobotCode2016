/*
This library uses PID and Encoder feedback to control a DC motor. It is modeled a little bit after the AccelStepper library.

HOOKUP:
I used a 754410 quad half-H controller (a pin-compatible L293D). I'm sure it would be cheaper to make out of other components, but i've never done transistor matching, and i'm afraid of burning things.

Example PINMAP:
754410
1&9       pinPWM
2&15      pin_dir
7&10      pin_dir
4&5&12&13 GND
16        5V
8         12V

3&14      motor pin 1
6&11      motor pin 2

HARDWARE:
Metal Gearmotor 37Dx57L mm with 64 CPR Encoder from www.pololu.com
Arduino
754410

PINS:
Pinout for motor control uses 3 pins for output. It is somewhat wasteful, but had more flexibility. Two pins for direction control, and one for motor power (assuming PWM).
Be sure to pick a PWM capable pin for pinPWM.

The two input pins are for the encoder feedback.

Two direcional pins allow for setting a motor brake by shorting the terminals of the motor together (set both directions HIGH, and preferably turn off the PWM)

TODO:
implement brake feature for 3-pin mode
2-pin constructor
implement friendlier tuning method for PID
