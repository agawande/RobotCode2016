Code is working - will try and deploy on raspberry pi now. Have tested it with my phone camera as the webcam (had to do lots of setup).
the webcam on the qr codes given on the Robot Rules and read the color yellow successfully (in isolation).
Try python readQR.py, or if you have a webcam ready - try python qrRead.py
(you might have to change the video port in the code if it is other than 1)
